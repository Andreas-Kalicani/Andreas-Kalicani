The tools that was used for this project is "React, Strapi, Material UI, Redux and Redux-toolkit for state mangement, yup for form validatation and React-icons for usage of icons". This is a demo only for practicing my skills

PS: Just demo website for personal project not real


* [VG scraper](https://github.com/Andreas-Kalicani/Web-scraper-vg): This is a simple web scraper that scrapes the header title and the url link to the specific articles from the big national newspaper from Norway VG. You can use it as you like to get information or find your favorite articles of today that you would like to read. It is just used for fun to learn little bit more about web scraping with node JS.

* [Redefine](https://github.com/Andreaskalicani/Redefine): We are creating a Website (4 persons) for a client in Copenhagen, a Service design agency start-up named REDEFINE. This is our final project through the bootcamp. We are using React, styled-components and Atomic design. 

* [Scrum Mars App](https://github.com/Andreaskalicani/hackathon11.05.2021): First Hackathon - we won the 2nd place. Our mission was to create an application that could be useful for Astronauts who are traveling to Mars.  We had 24 hours to create this application. With my team we decided to create a Scrum mars application where you could keep track of all your work, backlog and tasks - drag them when there are in process or finished. When one task is completed you receive points, in order to motivate each other to give their best. 

* [Travel Budget2.0](https://github.com/Andreaskalicani/travelbudget2.0): On our 2nd project we worked (4 persons) on a web app to manage and organize the budget of your travel and keep tracking of all your expenses. It shows the global budget and the daily amount available regarding your expenses and needs. We implemented an exchange rate API to convert directly the currency of the countries. In  this project we used React, styled-components, Chart.js, Bootstrap, Node.js and MySQL. You can check the web app deployed here [click to see Travel Budget](https://sheltered-sierra-28595.herokuapp.com/reports)

* [Color](https://github.com/Andreaskalicani/color): [Solo project] When we was still learning HTML, CSS and Javascript, I worked on this project to put the stacks in practice. It's suppose to be a client website which provides different services. I used linear gradient colors, some smooth scrool effects, responsiveness and used Javascript to create more interactions.

* [Project 1](https://github.com/saravalencia/Project1): This is our first project created during the bootcamp. With my team (3 persons) we developed a tourism destination Webiste where you could explore the site of Montjuic in Barcelona and get all information of how to get there, few history facts, where to eat and the best spots to explore the view of Montjuic. Tools we used in this project were HTML, CSS and Javascript.
